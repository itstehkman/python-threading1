Python threading tutorial using David Beazley's brilliant tutorial from PyCon 2015

The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCs5OvhV9S4

Notice that David uses Python 3, so there are subtle differences in the code.
I also put some comments to help me understand what is going on, and it may be useful for you too.
